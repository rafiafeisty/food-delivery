<p>This food delivery platform provides a complete and secure experience for users to order food from local restaurants.

The system is designed to handle multiple orders from a single user and even allows for order cancellations. Customers can easily keep track of their spending by viewing their total order list, and a real-time status tracker provides updates on their delivery, from the moment it's being prepared to when it arrives at their door. An administrative dashboard is also included, giving staff the ability to manage and monitor all orders to ensure a smooth operation.</p>
